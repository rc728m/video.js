This is a Demo for video.js video player.


To run this demo download all the given files in this folder ("Video.js Demo) only. 
You do not need to download the whole source code for the video player to run, 
I have included a minimized version in order to run this demo. 
It is assumed that you have Google Chrome installed on your computer.

The files required for a successful run on Chrome are the following:

- index.html
- video.min.js
- video-js.min.css
- playlist-thumbnails   //directory containing Photos.
	- llamadrama.png
	- sintel.png
	- tears-of-steel.png

Once downloaded open the index.html file in Google Chrome.
Right click on 'index.html'
Left click on 'Open with'
Left Click on 'Google Chrome'.





SAFARI NOTES:
As of now the video player will support DASH and HLS on Google Chrome. 
For IOS/Safari, DASH is not supported, for now this is a platform limitation. 
Until Apple adds MSE to their browsers Dash is off the table. 
Some IpadOS( Safari 13+) have now come out supporting MSE which enables DASH playback.

Safari also does its own native playback of HLS.
